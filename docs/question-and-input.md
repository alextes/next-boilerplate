# Infra

## Hosting

* There was talk about Google App engine at Rituals?

## CI / CD

* Does rituals' hosting env have any CI / CD integration already set up?

## Domains

* Most likely going to look like: rituals.world/giftcard

## Integration with other services

* Adyen for payment
* Intersolve for giftcard code gen
* Any other system that needs integration?

# Dev requirements

## i18n

* starting with EN / NL
* No RTL languages in future

## Accessibility?

* Not sure if we have any checks here, most likely just basic support as usual

## Styleguide

* There's a styleguide available from Rituals
  * Comes with a JS bundle that does dom manipulation

## Stack

* Depends a bit on the above. If we use the styleguide (inc js bundle) we may want to use a very basic setup, just plain old js dom manipulation?
